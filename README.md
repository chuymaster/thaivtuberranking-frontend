## Setup

- See Documentation on Flutter site https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web

## Local Command

See `Makefile`. Run `make help` to see the available commands.

Run `make run` to start the application locally.

## API Document

See https://github.com/chuymaster/thaivtuberranking-docs

## Automated Deployment

- Auto trigger deploy to Netlify production site when `production` branch is updated. Host: https://vtuber.chuysan.com/#/
- Auto trigger deploy to Netlify QA site when `main` branch is updated. Host: https://vtuber-qa-chuysan.netlify.app/#/

## Branch Strategy

- Use only `main` branch without long-live feature branch. ([GitHub Flow](https://www.flagship.io/git-branching-strategies/))
- PR will be generated automatically by GitHub action. Merge it to promote to `production` when ready.

## Unit Tests

This project use [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) to generate mock classes.

`http.Client` mock is already generated but if you need to generate new mock class, read the document, add `@GenerateMocks` annotation then run `make build-mock` to generate.

See `video_ranking_repository.dart` and `video_ranking_repository_test.dart` for example of API stub implementation.

Run `flutter test` to test all cases.
